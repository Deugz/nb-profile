```{note}

With Ross, I am planning to test the implementation of 'the method' with a **scientific investigation**. The aim is to embed an individual contribution within a completely novel and fully online scientific publication model. This model is made of a constellation of websites bounded together by dedicated links and semantic information. The information is added incrementally depending on researcher direction and needs, using the note taking capabilities and tool of JupyterBook and myst markdown.
